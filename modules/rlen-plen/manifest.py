"""RLEN PLEN -- a recorder length equal to one loop of the track's pattern.

RLEN counts master-clock 16ths (no scale term, 0x4006e3b2 / 0x40006dfc) and
stops at 64, so a 1/4X track cannot record its own 16-bar pattern at a fixed
length; MAX has no length at all (the recording ends at the next recorder
trig, docs/firmware/RECORDER.md 2a), which is why a manual loop needs TRIG
ONE2 and a second press. This module adds RLEN value 65, drawn PLEN: one
press under TRIG ONE + QREC PLEN records exactly the next pass and stops.

One cave, three entries:

  cave    hooked at 0x40006da6, the arm converter's RLEN read (replayed).
          Raw 65 computes L = len x ticks[scale] x 2,646,000 / tempo24,
          rounded to nearest, and rejoins the fixed-RLEN path at 0x40006e18
          with d4 = L (the stock product would overflow past 67 steps).
          Length and scale are read as the sequencer's step function
          0x4009da20 reads them: bank 0x800065bd, pattern 0x800065be,
          pattern record 0x400eb034 + p x 0x8ed8 + b x 0x9b340 (scale +0,
          length -1, PER TRACK flag +1); PER TRACK: the track record
          0x400e21e0 + t x 0x91a + the same offset (+0x50 length, +0x51
          scale). Ticks per step from the sequencer's table 0x400aba50.
  screen  the RECORDING SETUP drawer's push of the stock RLEN formatter
          (0x4002fb10, `move.l d4,-(sp); pea 0x4002f224`) replayed with
          `fmt` pushed instead -- a six-byte poke, not a second hook.
  fmt     fmt(buf, value): 65 -> the stock "PLEN" string (0x400b541c), else
          the stock RLEN formatter (1..64, MAX).

Plus three pokes: the descriptor's RLEN count (E = 0x400d3c74, +0xd2 +
2 x 4) 65 -> 66, which the setup editor clamps by (0x4002efd2), so the
encoder reaches PLEN; and the part validator's hard-coded 64 (0x40002c72 /
0x40002c78) -> 65, which otherwise rewrites a stored 65 to MAX on every bank
load (measured under the port: the file parser 0x400165dc stores 65, the
validator 0x40002c7a wrote 64 over it). Raw 0..64 keep their meaning; saved parts need no
restamp. RECORDER SPACING (hook 0x40006e0c) is bypassed on the PLEN path:
its next-arm model is for chained sequencer passes, and a PLEN take ended by
the next arm is a MAX take anyway.

Not measured: the drawn PLEN text (the port renders the screen; not run),
a manual REC press under the port (the key handler is not located; the
length path is exercised by a sequencer recorder trig, which takes the same
converter), and the PER TRACK branch on hardware.

Placement: a DRAM unit in the platform runtime (28 Sep 2026; a floating ROM
cave until then). The unit is position-independent (the one self-reference
is a pc-relative pea), so the build's oracle links it alone at the old
overflow-run address and holds it to the sha256 of the ratified bytes below;
the two hooks are `jsr` detours to the same entries the cave hook and the
screen poke reached. Moved because beside bottleservice's clones, label
formatters and TEMPO BUS the ROM zero runs had no 298 B left.
