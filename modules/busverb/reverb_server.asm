; BusVerb: an eight-line FDN reverb. Four series input allpasses into eight
; 4096-word lines (spacing 0x1000, modulo 0xFFF) with an 8x8 fast
; Walsh-Hadamard, one-pole damping and a low cut inside the feedback path,
; an interpolated LFO on every line, a shimmer pitch shifter, a gate and
; mid/side width. The tank tap loop and the write-back loop are rolled over
; a per-line state table in absolute Y; lines 0 and 1 carry an in-loop
; allpass, lines 2-7 do not.
;
; The buffer base is the literal Y:0x4000, every instance: the bank's whole
; FX2 allocation (0x4000..0xBFFF) is the eight lines. Every other buffer is
; in this core's half of the shared window (build_bus.py rewrites the base
; literal per payload):

;              taps to ~3914 (89 ms) at SIZE max
;   pre-delay  shared+0x1000 .. 0x1fff      4096 words: mapped and cleared

;   shimmer    shared+0x0800 ..             2048 words (NOSHIM=1 excises it)
;   in-loop AP shared+0x4000/0x4200         512 words each, taps 298 446
;   tank state shared+0x4500 .. 0x453f      table A (6 words/line) at +0x4500,

;   bloom APs  shared+0x4800/0x5000         2048 words each, taps 1801/1291

; Housekeeping is normally done by position 0 (r7 == 0x6200, the bank's first
; FX2 call). That alone breaks the moment the first track's FX2 is NONE: our
; code never runs there, so nobody flips the rotation or clears the
; accumulators, and the bus saturates. NONE became selectable with the task-11
; menu, so this is reachable in ordinary use.
;
; Self-healing election instead. Position 0 still housekeeps whenever it runs.
; Any other instance takes over if it sees that the rotation has NOT changed
; since the last time it ran -- which can only mean nobody housekept in
; between. Costs one r7 word (the rotation this instance last saw) and no new
; global signal, so it needs nothing the bus does not already have.
;
; Gated on the split offset FIRST: only a block's first call may housekeep, so
; a split block's second call can never flip a second time -- the same trap

; A shared-memory bus is housekept by ONE core only: both cores number their

; housekeeper and they would flip the shared rotation TWICE a block, cancelling
; out and silently desyncing the bus -- the same trap the split-call gate
; below was written around, one level up. Payload B is sent straight to
; bus_notfirst, so it still finds this block's write targets but never elects.

; ---- this call's REVERB ACC read address and WET write address ----------
; READ is the OTHER buffer from the current write rotation -- the one every
; SEND client (and our own dry sum, below) finished filling last block
; (one-block latency, BUS.md's Mechanism section). WRITE uses the SAME
; rotation clients currently write into, so it is complete and ready by the
; time next block flips -- for a future cross-bus reader (task 10), not
; consumed by anything yet.
; y:>$900 holds the WRITE OFFSET already scaled by the 16-word buffer stride,
; so the write addresses need no shift at all. THE READ TARGET IS TWO BUFFERS
; BACK, `write + 32 & $30` -- with four buffers that leaves an idle block on
; each side of the reader, which is the cross-core race fix (see the layout
; note in modules/send/send_client.asm).
; ---- chain_live: is the delay (chain stage 1) running? -------------------
; The delay stamps y:$9c3 nonzero every block it processes (after its
; warm-up); this reads it, clears it (clear-on-read, single writer, single
; reader -- the station has its own word, $9c5) and keeps 3 blocks of grace
; in CORE-PRIVATE y:$09f1 (r7 is full). The tank hears the REV accumulator
; (every REV send and this host's own SEND) plus, while the delay is live,
; the chain buffer (the repeats x DLY); a chain gain of 0 keeps a stale
; chain out when it is not (25 Sep 2026: the sends split into DEL and REV;
; the aux was the reverb's input until then).

; rather than clear-on-read: a stamp lost to the other core's timing would
; step the delay's gain for a block. Not $9d3..$9d7: per-block state there
; was dead on hardware, mechanism unknown. What would falsify this: a delay
; whose level drops by 1/sqrt(N) when the reverb host's SEND comes up with
; nothing playing on it.

; ---- every buffer base, derived once per block --------------------------
;
; TWO REGIONS SINCE THE SHARED-WINDOW RE-LAYOUT (9 Aug 2026).
;
; The private allocation Y:0x4000-0xBFFF now carries THE EIGHT TANK LINES AND
; NOTHING ELSE, so they are free to grow into all 32,768 words of it. Every
; other buffer moved to this core's own half of the 64K shared window.
;
; Why the lines get the private half and not the shared one: the lines are the
; only thing needing a single UNBROKEN, self-aligned 32K block, and the private
; allocation is the only unbroken 32K there is. The shared half is fragmented
; by two things we do not own -- stock's per-frame parameter staging at
; 0x30000-0x30047, rewritten EVERY FRAME, and the bus scratch at
; 0x36000-0x37FFF -- so it suits the small buffers, which fit around them.
;
; ✅ The shared half really is ours: stock's own FX2 allocator table at X:0x255
; hands payload A 0x30000/0x34000 and payload B 0x38000/0x3C000, measured from
; the raw image (XBUS.md). The cores' shared-window slots do not overlap.
;
; ⚠️ THE `$30000` BELOW IS REWRITTEN TO `$38000` ON PAYLOAD B by build_bus.py's
; blanket per-payload substitution, and that is CORRECT here -- a reverb on
; core 1 must use core 1's half or it would collide with core 0's reverb in the
; same physical memory. It also means this literal must not be spelled any
; other way, and that no unrelated `$30000` may appear in this file.
;
; Everything below still derives from x0, so the only change to the shape of
; this block is which base x0 holds.
; ($10..$13, lines 0-3's bare bases, were still stored here until 14 Sep
; 2026 -- 20 words with no reader in this file, the roll source or the
; build's LFO slot tables.)
; $36/$37 are line bases the rolled tap loop no longer reads.
; r1..r4 carry lines 0..3 inside the sample loop (built from the saved
; phase, below). $36/$37 and $4c/$4d carry the four new lines for the
; state-table priming carry seed -- those are the only places that need
; a bare line base (without phase) for lines 4..7.

; ---- TONE, upper half = HI: the high cut inside the feedback path ---------
; The one-pole is s += c*(d-s), so a LARGE c tracks the input and keeps
; highs: LP 0 gives c = 0.125 (dark), LP 127 gives c ~ 0.99 (bright).
; ONE TONE KNOB (page-2 slot 7, $c's companion) DRIVES BOTH CUTS. TONE 0..64
; is LP 0..127 with HP at 0 (dark to flat); 64..127 is HP 0..126 with LP
; wide open (flat to thin). Both halves come from ONE sub: b = (TONE-64)<<16
; sets N while TONE < 64, and the tmi floors it to a clean 0 for the LO
; block below (HP-equivalent = 2*(TONE-64), so 0 up to 64: bypassed exactly).
; The LP-equivalent is min(2*TONE, 127), the clamp a second Tcc off the same
; sub (moves between, so the CCR survives): TONE >= 64 loads 63.5<<16 before
; the doubling, which is 127<<16 after it -- the old default EXACTLY.
; ⚠️ Letting the store limiter clamp instead (drop the tpl: 2*TONE<<16 is
; >= 1.0 from TONE 64 up and `move a,x0` saturates it to $7fffff) was tried
; to save 3 words and rendered -1.7 dB different from the old default: LP
; 127.99 is c = 1.0, a one-pole with NO high loss per pass, where 127 is
; 0.993 and its -0.12 dB per pass compounds over the tail. TONE 63 vs old
; LP 126 (no limiter involved) rendered bit-identical, which is what pins
; the arithmetic; TONE 64 vs old HP 0 / LP 127 is the default's own gate.

; decimated 2:1, so step/0.5 is the pitch ratio), low to high:

; delay -- not in the input diffusion chain (that placement measured
; worse). An allpass in the feedback path multiplies echo density on every
; circulation, which is how a smooth tail comes out of finite memory. We had
; none at all: one echo per line per pass, where Dattorro gets a burst.
;
; Two of them, 512 words each, now in the SHARED WINDOW at +0x4000/+0x4200.
; They share m5 = $7ff with the input diffusers, so no M write.
;
; x0 held the PRIVATE base from the two AGU-clearing loads above, and the
; private allocation now carries tank lines only, so it is reloaded here.
; Those two loads still have to happen -- they exist to space the AGU write,
; not to deliver a value -- so this costs one instruction, not three.

; ---- prime the IN-LOOP ALLPASS interpolation carries ---------------------
; The same seeding the four tank lines get above, for the same reason, and
; the allpasses did not have until later.
;
; The carried d1 is only "last sample's d0" while the READ OFFSET holds
; still. Inside a block it does: r5 walks one per sample and n5 is fixed.
; Across a block boundary the AP offsets ($52/$54) step with their LFO, and
; then the carry is off by one -- it is d0 or d2, not d1. On a DOWNWARD step
; the fraction is near 1.0, so the interpolator outputs that wrong neighbour
; almost in full: a one-sample error at tail amplitude, fed straight back
; into the loop by the allpass it sits in. Once per block per allpass, at
; the LFO's integer-crossing rate.
;
; Priming costs ~26 instructions per BLOCK -- under 2 cycles/sample
; amortised, against the measured spare (make cycles) -- and needs no extra N register, which
; is what the in-loop comment ("no other way to do this") ruled out. That
; was true per SAMPLE; it is not true once per block.

; ---- SHIMMER v3: +12 octave up, half-traverse windows (2026-08-09) -------
; WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, found with an impulse and nothing else. Feed the
; shifter ONE sample and count what comes out:
;
;   v101 / v127 window:  4 events, +18/41/64/87 ms, ALL AT -25 dB
;   this window:         2 events, +18/41 ms,       both at -13 dB
;
; Four equal copies of every transient at 23 ms spacing IS the stutter. Sam,
; 9 Aug, on a same-buffer same-loudness A/B of exactly this one change:
; "B sounded like a single pitch shifted tone where A had the stutter."
;
; WHY FOUR. A slot lives 2N samples (the write pointer advances half a slot a
; sample) and a read head crosses the whole buffer in N, so each head passes
; every slot TWICE before it is overwritten -- 4 passes for 2 heads. The old
; window was a function of the head's ABSOLUTE BUFFER INDEX, so head 1 read
; slot k at the SAME gain on both passes and nothing was ever suppressed.
;
; THE FIX: window on the AGE of the data under the head -- its distance behind
; the write pointer -- and make that window ZERO over half the age range. Each
; head then emits a given slot on one pass and mutes it on the other, so two
; copies come out instead of four. Head 2's age runs exactly 1024 behind head
; 1's, so the halves are complementary and one head is always live: no gap.
;
; TWO COPIES IS THE FLOOR, not a compromise. Doubling pitch in the time domain
; means replaying every piece of material once -- that is what the algorithm
; IS. A phase vocoder would avoid it and does not fit in this budget.
;
; RETRACTED ALONG THE WAY, all measured better on a metric and all inaudible
; or worse to Sam: a longer buffer (1024 vs 2048 "basically the same"), the
; crossfade period (made it much worse -- moved lap energy onto a bare 86 Hz
; drone), and an equal-power crossfade law ("sounds the same"). The 1.83 dB
; midpoint dip a linear crossfade causes is real and is NOT what was audible.
; Only the copy count ever mattered. Measure the impulse response first.
;
; WINDOW SHAPE. g(age) = clamp01( (512 - |age-512|) / 256 ): a trapezoid that
; rises over age 0..256, holds at 1 to 768, falls to zero by 1024, and stays
; zero for the whole upper half. Zero AT age 0 is what puts the splice where
; the head is silent -- age 0 is exactly where the head sits on the write
; pointer's discontinuity. The flat top is what keeps the pair summing to ~1;
; a pure triangle over the half-range would dip to zero twice a lap.
;
; TRAP (AGENTS.md): `cmp a,b` has silently encoded as `max a,b`, which updates
; only C while bge tests N^V. No cmp here at all -- the two comparisons are
; done as `sub` + branch, which sets N and V properly. Every mpy is x0,y1 or
; x1,x0 (signed) except head 1's frac multiply, an audited mpysu (y0 >= 0).
