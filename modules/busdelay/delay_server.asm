; BusDelay: a two-line ping-pong delay with feedback tone-shaped by a one-pole
; low-pass inside the loop, and three engines on the same lines -- CLEAN,
; GRAIN (four unity-rate grain readers per line, one continuous pitch) and
; REVERSE (the two lines as one 32K mono ring, segments played backwards) --
; with a sticky tempo snap on TIME.
; CYCLES_FORWARD_BRANCHES -- the REVERSE skips of the R line are forward
; branches the pricer admits.
;
; The LineL base is one hardcoded literal (Y:0x30000, the shared window)
; that build_bus.py rewrites per payload with a blanket text replace over the
; whole source, comments included, and censuses; shared-window addresses
; elsewhere in this file are offsets from a register-held base. The lines are
; plain circular buffers wrapped by hand (m1/m2 stay linear): the read
; address is base + ((wr - TIME) & mask) and the post-write pointer folds
; back the same way. THE GEOMETRY FOLLOWS THE PLACEMENT (tools/remix/geom.py:
; lines tagged `; @B` ship, `; @DEV` are the hatch's):
;   shipping (payload B, core 1), 741 ms of TIME:
;     LineL   base .. base+0x7fff          32768 words, the whole shared half
;     LineR   Y:0x4000 .. Y:0xbfff         32768 words, the core's private FX2
;             buffer region -- nothing else on core 1 writes it (measured
;             under the port on OCTABAM89 C02, 900 frames, 15 Sep 2026); on
;             core 0 it is the reverb's tank, which is why this is B-only
;   DEV hatch (payload A beside the reverb), 371 ms:
;     LineL   base .. base+0x3fff          16384 words
;     LineR   base+0x4000 .. base+0x7fff   16384 words
; A knob value means the same TIME in both (64 + value*256 samples, clamped
; to the line), so at any TIME the hatch can reach the two render
; bit-identically (verify_twocore). REVERSE's 32K mono ring is LineL's
; space in both.
;
; Input enters LineL, and LineR scaled by 1-PING; PING is a continuous 2x2
; crossfeed on the feedback path:
;        fbIntoL = fL*(1-PING) + fR*PING
;        fbIntoR = fR*(1-PING) + fL*PING
;        LineL[write] = x_in + fbIntoL*FDBK
;        LineR[write] = x_in*(1-PING) + fbIntoR*FDBK
; The loop gain per line is a convex combination of fL/fR scaled by FDBK, so
; stability does not depend on PING. (Summing the input into both lines
; unscaled makes the two state equations identical for a mono source, and
; PING does nothing.)
;
; Every proc() call runs the position-0 rotation-flip-and-clear housekeeping
; modules/send/send_client.asm describes (copied byte for byte: a divergent
; copy desyncs the bus silently), sums the shared DELAY accumulator into its
; input, multiplies by the auto-gain 1/sqrt(N) and writes its stage output
; (wet*DLY, mono, DLY = BusVerb's page-2 knob via y:$982) to the chain buffer
; for the reverb. The host track prints wet*WET under its dry (20 Sep 2026: the wet leaves through the
; host and the chain and nowhere else; the published stereo stage output and
; the T8 return went); its own audio reaches the engine only through SEND.
;
; State in the per-instance r7 block. The numbers below are raw slots; the
; code from `bus_mine:` to `dry:` spells them rebased -- r7 is moved $49

init:
; ---- seed the tracked rotation, so a cold boot cannot start out of step ---
; ⚠️ THE TRACKING CANNOT SELF-CORRECT A BAD START, and the commit that added it
; claimed otherwise. "This client legitimately read PRE-FLIP" and "this client
; is stuck one step AHEAD" give an identical comparison result, every block,
; forever -- no observation separates them, so a client that boots one step
; ahead stays there. Harmless when written; NOT harmless once the clear moved
; one block ahead, because a client stuck one step ahead then writes precisely
; the buffer core 0 is clearing, and every core-1 sender is wiped. That was the
; metallic on every power cycle of R25, and why re-selecting the effect cured
; it: the instance misses blocks during the switch, falls BEHIND, and snaps.
; If it cannot self-correct it must begin correct. init runs on instantiation
; -- exactly what re-selecting does -- so seeding here makes a cold boot
; deterministic. The shared word may advance one step before the first proc;
; that direction DOES snap, so it is safe.
; build_bus.py emits a body here for PAYLOAD B ONLY -- payload A recomputes the
; offset from the shared word every block and has nothing to seed.

; Housekeeping is normally done by position 0 (r7 == 0x6200, the bank's first

;
; Self-healing election instead. Position 0 still housekeeps whenever it runs.
; Any other instance takes over if it sees that the rotation has NOT changed

; ⚠️ CLEAR THE BUFFER WRITTEN **NEXT** BLOCK, NOT THIS ONE.
; Clearing the buffer we are about to write races the OTHER core's writers:
; core 0 clears at the start of its block and everyone fills it during that
; block, so a core-1 writer that gets there BEFORE core 0's housekeeper has
; its contribution written and then wiped. Straddle that boundary and the
; sender drops out on some blocks and not others -- intermittent dropout,
; which is broadband hash exactly like the two defects before it.
; The four-buffer rotation fixed clear-vs-READ and the per-core tracking fixed
; which-buffer; NEITHER touches clear-vs-WRITE. This does, and it is free:
; with four buffers there is an idle slot. The buffer written next block was
; last READ a full block ago and will not be WRITTEN for another full block,
; so clearing it now has a block of margin on both sides.

; ---- THE GRAIN COUNT IS A BUILD-TIME LEVER (4 Sep 2026) -------------------
; Four grains per line is what this source assembles to. A remix that
; declares `grains=2` (schema.Remix) has build_bus.py substitute three
; things at the markers below, and nothing else changes:
;
;   ; GRAINCNT  the two rolled loops count 2 instead of 4
;   ; GRAINOFF  the grain-to-grain phase offset doubles, G/4 -> G/2, so two
;              grains still tile the cycle
;   ; GRAINMK   the makeup doubles, because FOUR triangle windows at quarter
;              offsets sum to exactly 2 while TWO at half offsets sum to
;              exactly 1 -- so the same coefficient would land 6 dB down
;
; WHY: cycles, not sound. The delay's core cannot carry four active stations
; beside a four-grain GRAIN (3,294 of 3,120 by the pricer); at two grains it
; fits. The cost is half the simultaneous grain voices, which is an ear
; decision, not a correctness one.
;
; ⚠️ THE HALF-OFFSET CASE HAS AN EXACT TEST and the quarter-offset one does
; not: two triangle windows a half period apart sum to exactly 1, so DC in
; must come back flat. That is the gate that caught a double-rate
; window (AGENTS.md, the a0 trap), and it is why the two-grain build is the
; better-checked of the two.
;
; GRAIN's PERSISTENT latches: eight scatters, eight window multipliers and
; eight read advances, each re-latched at its own grain's wrap. A garbage
; scatter subtracts straight into a read address and a garbage multiplier
; is a garbage window for one grain-life, so both start at 0.

; the 32K line (the hatch's 16K). Past it a head reads across the write
; pointer, a full-scale discontinuity once per grain. The loop re-derives
; the base per sample from the ramped TIME. sub/tst, not cmp (the

; and the dispatcher's copy of this block right after the rts lands inside
; it: the pull reads the block mid-rewrite (junk on main R, 0.5/min on
; image 99, docs/contributing/FAILURE_MODES.md). Stock effects copy by +2
; samples. Measured on the unit with a WOW-selected pad here (image 36):
; +0 cycles 1266 junk runs/min, +256 16/min, +512 0/min over 60 s and
; 1.4/min over 10 min, +2048 0/60 s. Running the compute from the
; dispatcher's idle instead (images 39-42) killed core 1: its idle is a
; word-by-word handshake with core 0, not free time. So the copy waits
; here, past the pull: 8,192 NOPs, two samples, 11 % of the frame.
