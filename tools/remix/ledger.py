"""Cross-module resource collisions, caught before a byte is written.

The build refuses to start when two selected modules claim the same
resource, and says which two.

Checked, and how it knows:

  fx2 ids            declared. Two modules on one id would overwrite each
                     other's descriptor and dispatch.
  ColdFire caves     declared. Overlapping machine code is silent and fatal.
  hook sites         declared. Two modules hooking one instruction: the
                     second overwrites the first's jsr and the first never
                     runs.
  detours, pokes,    declared. Fixed-address rewrites, checked against every
  table refs,        cave, hook site and emit poke; a runtime's recipe
  runtime writes     writes are claims of the same kind.
  overrides          a bridge's claim stands in for the overridden module's
                     at that site; a bridge naming a module the remix does
                     not carry is refused.
  DSP hook sites     declared (DspSection.hooks). Two sections hooking one
                     stock P word on one payload: the second jsr overwrites
                     the first.
  on-chip SRAM       declared (Claims.sram). A DMA engine's descriptors and
                     buffers there; two modules on one window corrupt each
                     other's transfers.
  core-private Y     derived by scanning the module's source for `y:>$09xx`.
                     Low Y is per core, not per instance, so every effect
                     sharing a core shares these words.
  stock buffers      declared (Claims.stock_instance_buffer). A stock effect
                     that takes an instance buffer from the host's bump
                     allocator gets a per-track base -- the addresses
                     BusVerb and BusDelay hardcode -- and the chooser
                     is one list for all eight tracks, so the build cannot
                     know which track it lands on. Refused beside any module
                     with fixed Y buffers.
  appended runtimes  one per image (the end of the OS and the loader's
                     window).
  arena reserves     the total must leave the unit sample memory.

Derived beats declared where possible: a scan cannot go stale. Its limit is
that it sees only what the code references, so a word a module means to
reserve but does not yet touch is declared (Claims.reserved_private_y).

Not checked: the shared 64K window (Y:0x30000-0x3FFFF); the two servers'
buffer extents there are not established well enough to write down. The P
donor region is not here either: placement refuses to overrun it, exactly.

    # FX1 then FX2, so track k's FX2 effect always gets entry 1+2k
