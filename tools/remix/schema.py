"""What a remix module declares about itself.

A module is one contribution to the firmware: an FX2 engine, a bus client, a
ColdFire behaviour patch, or a combination. A remix is a named selection of
modules composed into one image. This file is the vocabulary both sides
speak: a manifest is the one place a module's facts are written, and the
build, the checks and the harness all read the same statement.

The schema declares what the build reads. A declared-but-unchecked claim is
worse than none, so a field exists only where a check consumes it.

# a client nothing reads: with no server in the image, nothing ever consumes
# the bus accumulators SEND writes.
#
# So a remix may name this sentinel instead, and unimplemented ids resolve to
# the FIRMWARE's own NONE: its descriptor (the one at list position 0 of a
# stock FX2 chooser, which our rebuilt list otherwise drops) and, on the DSP
# side, the per-payload null stub the build already points silenced donor ids
# at. It costs one list row -- four bytes of cave -- and no words at all.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS REFUSED BESIDE ANY BUS PARTICIPANT, and that is the whole safety
# argument. Housekeeping -- flipping the rotation word and clearing the
# accumulators, once per block -- is gated to payload A and done by the FIRST
# CORE-0 PARTICIPANT DISPATCHED that block (send_client.asm's `bus_seen`
# election). Today every unassigned track runs SEND, so core 0 always has
# one. Under this fallback an unassigned track runs nothing, so a project
# with tracks 5-8 all unassigned has no housekeeper -- and a server on the
# OTHER core then reads an accumulator that is never rotated and never
# cleared. With no server and no client in the image there is no bus, no
# rotation and nothing to clear, so the question does not arise. That is the
# only case this is allowed in; registry.remix() enforces it.
#

# what keeps the question off the table rather than answered by inference.

    chooser order is wanted.

    STOCK effects are listed by the same keys ("FILTER", "CHORUS", ...):
    tools/remix/stock.py. A stock effect NOT listed is not removed from the

    neither chooser gives up its words (stock.harvested); the three reverbs

    THE FALLBACK IS NOT OPTIONAL, and it is the question a selective build

    #     it is why such a module is one per core -- but an FX1 row
    #     doubles the slots it can be reached from, a second instance on the
    #     SAME track included.
    #   * A bus SERVER, which is one per core by design (SPEC places one
    #     engine per payload). A second instance on a core is the open
    #     "duplicate instances corrupt audio after ~5.45 s" item.
    #
    # What is left is exactly the INSERT class (Spectrum, Character) -- and
    # SEND, which is buffer-free (untested there, but nothing measured
    # argues against it).
    # PLACED BUT NOT LISTED. Each key here is carried by the image -- code,
    # id, descriptor clone -- and takes NO CHOOSER ROW, with its twelve
    # parameter names blanked so the track page it lands on draws no knobs.
    #
    # This is how an effect stops being a per-track choice and becomes part
    # of the instrument: the two bus engines are hosted by the project stamp,
    # not by turning a chooser, and their controls live on a main-menu screen
    # instead of a track page (docs/firmware/MAINMENU.md section 6). Blanking the
    # NAMES is what empties the page: the parameter COUNTS and enable bits
    # stay, so the stock parameter writer still clamps and commits every slot
    # and the frame builder still carries it to the DSP -- measured in the
    # emulator, both halves (the page drew nothing; the writer
    # landed a value in the Part).
    #
    # ⚠️ IT BELONGS TO THE REMIX, NOT THE MODULE, and the bit-identity gate
    # is what said so: declared on the module, hiding the engines emptied
    # the plain `bus` image's chooser too, from three rows to one. A remix
    # hides an engine only when it also carries the screen that edits it.
    #
    # ⚠️ IT DOES NOT MAKE THE ID PRIVATE. Dispatch is per id and shared by
    # every track and both menus, so a saved part that names this id ANYWHERE
    # runs this code. A module that must run on one track only has to detect
    # that itself, the way modules/modulation does with its allocator slot.
